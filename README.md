# SummitPublicSchools_Internship
Here are a few of projects I worked on while interning at Summit.

Agenda Replicator: This script uses Google Drive API to generate copies of a base document, and place them in specified folders. 
                   Links to those copies are automatically uploaded to a Google Sheet.
                   
Web Scraper: This script uses Selenium to go through a student platform and scrape data pertaining to mentor check-ins.

Email Remover: The purpose of this script was to use Selenium in order to remove faulty teacher accounts from the company's student platform.
